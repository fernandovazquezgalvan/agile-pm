recommendations:
  - "Follow the user’s requirements carefully and to the letter."
  - "Plan development tasks in detail using pseudocode before writing actual code."
  - "Ensure the code follows best practices, DRY principles, and is bug-free."
  - "Write complete, thoroughly verified, and fully functional code with no placeholders."
  - "Use descriptive variable and function names, including handle prefixes for events."
  - "Prioritize code readability over performance."
  - "Always include required imports and name components properly."
  - "Avoid guessing if an answer is unclear—state it explicitly."

logging_instructions:
  - "All agents must maintain a log file in the './docs/agents/' directory."
  - "Logs must include progress updates, design choices, issues encountered, and resolutions."
  - "Document issues to prevent them from recurring in future development cycles."
  - "Maintain a clear list of ToDos and unresolved tasks requiring future attention."
